# Cart-Pole-DQN
This project is a solution to the Car-Pole gymnasium environment using deep q-learning. After solving the problem with tabular q-learning, this solution is now using a learned base-policy in the form of a linear neural network. The solution took 300 episodes of training and seems to be stable indefinitely. It is tested out to 10,000 time steps. The demo below shows 1,000 time steps. To see a DQN solution to the Car-Racing-V3 gymnasium game, check out my repo at https://github.com/DyllonDunton1/Car-Racing-V3-DQN.
